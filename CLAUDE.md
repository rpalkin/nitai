# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`ai-reviewer` is a self-hosted AI-powered PR review system that posts summary and inline review comments on merge requests. It uses Restate for durable workflow orchestration, Pydantic AI for LLM-based review, and Qdrant for semantic code search.

**Current status:** Phase 1 (MVP) complete. Phase 2 (Semantic Search & Context-Aware Review) in progress — subphases 2.1–2.4 done (webhooks, dispatch, debounce, draft tracking). See `specs/phases.md` for the full roadmap, `specs/phase2-plan.md` for current phase details, and `specs/later.md` for known issues and deferred items.

Full technical design: `specs/overview.md`

## Extra instructions
- always use gopls lsp plugin while working with golang code
- always build binaries into `out` folder that is put to gitignore

## Working on the current phase

When asked to "work on current phase" (or similar), follow these steps:

### 1. Determine the current phase

Check in this order:
1. **Git branch name** — look for a pattern like `phase-X-Y` (e.g. `phase-2-5` → phase 2, subphase 5).
2. **Working directory name** — if running inside a git worktree, the folder may be named `nitai-phase-X-Y`.
3. **Ask the user** if neither of the above gives a clear result.

### 2. Read the phase plan and determine status

Open `specs/phaseX-plan.md` and find the relevant subphase section. Check its status marker:

- **`✓ Done`** — tell the user it is already complete and stop.
- **`🚧 In progress`** — find the current progress by reading the code and continue implementing.
- **`🧪 In test`** — tell the user it is in test and stop (no action yet).
- **No marker / not started** — treat it as ready to begin.

### 3. Before starting work

Mark the subphase as `🚧 In progress` in `specs/phaseX-plan.md`.

### 4. After completing work

Mark the subphase as `🧪 In test` in `specs/phaseX-plan.md`, then follow the **Completing a subphase** steps above.

## Completing a subphase

When a subphase is implemented, do the following in order:

1. **Update `specs/phases.md`** — set Phase N status to `In progress` (if not already), add the subphase to the `Completed` list. Keep notes brief; details belong in the phase plan file.
2. **Update `specs/phaseN-plan.md`** — mark the subphase heading `✓ Done`, add an `### Implementation notes` section following the style in `phase1-plan.md`: use `**What changed from the plan:**` for deviations and `**Architectural decisions:**` for design choices made during implementation.

## Components

Each component has its own `CLAUDE.md` with detailed architecture and commands:

| Component | Description | CLAUDE.md |

| [go-services](go-services/) | Go Restate handlers — DiffFetcher, PostReview, PRReview orchestrator | [go-services/CLAUDE.md](go-services/CLAUDE.md) |
| [reviewer](reviewer/) | Python Restate service — Pydantic AI agent, LLM-based code review | [reviewer/CLAUDE.md](reviewer/CLAUDE.md) |
| [indexer](indexer/) | Python CLI — indexes Git repos into Qdrant with tree-sitter chunking | [indexer/CLAUDE.md](indexer/CLAUDE.md) |
| [search-mcp](search-mcp/) | Python FastMCP server — semantic code search over Qdrant | [search-mcp/CLAUDE.md](search-mcp/CLAUDE.md) |
| [proto](proto/) | Protobuf API definitions (provider, repo, review services) | — |

## Commands

Requires Docker and Docker Compose. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required variables.

```bash
# Start the full stack (builds images, runs migrations, registers Restate services automatically)
make up
# or: docker compose up -d --build

# Tear down
make down
# or: docker compose down

# Tail all logs
make logs

# Run smoke tests (verifies Restate registration, service health)
make smoke
# or: ./tests/smoke.sh [--no-teardown]

# Run e2e tests (mock mode — no external services needed, requires Docker)
make e2e

# Run e2e tests in live mode (requires a real GitLab instance)
E2E_LIVE=1 \
GITLAB_URL=https://gitlab.example.com \
GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-... \
GITLAB_MR_IID=42 \
GITLAB_PROJECT_REMOTE_ID=123 \
make e2e

# Note: gen/go/ is gitignored — run `make proto` before running e2e tests

# Run unit tests (Go: go test in api-server + go-services)
make unit

# Run full unit test suite with vet, build, and compile checks (go-services only)
./tests/unit.sh

# Generate protobuf code (gen/go/ is gitignored — must run before first build)
make proto

# Index a repository (one-shot, runs and exits)
REPO_PATH=/path/to/repo docker compose run --rm indexer

# Pass extra flags to the indexer
REPO_PATH=/path/to/repo docker compose run --rm indexer /repo --recreate

# Install Python modules locally (for linting / IDE support)
pip install -e indexer/
pip install -e search-mcp/
pip install -e reviewer/

# Test search via CLI client (against search-mcp on :8081)
python search-mcp/client.py list
python search-mcp/client.py search <collection> "query text" [--top-k 5]
```

### Restate service registration

Restate requires all worker/reviewer HTTP deployments to be **registered** before it can route workflow invocations. Registration is handled automatically by the `restate-register` init container, which runs once on `docker compose up` and exits. It waits for Restate to be healthy, then POSTs to `/deployments` for both the `worker` (`:9080`) and `reviewer` (`:9090`) services.

Re-registration is idempotent — running `docker compose up` again is safe.

**Restate UI:** `http://localhost:9071` — shows invocation history, workflow state, and registered services.

To verify registered services manually:
```bash
curl http://localhost:9070/services | jq '.services[].name'
# Expected: DiffFetcher, PostReview, PRReview, Reviewer
```

### Infrastructure

- **PostgreSQL** — providers, repos, review runs, review comments. Migrations managed by golang-migrate (embedded in api-server binary).
- **Restate** — durable workflow orchestration. Virtual Object `PRReview` ensures one review per MR at a time.
- **Qdrant** — vector database on ports `6333` (REST) and `6334` (gRPC), with data persisted in `./db`. One collection per repository, named from git remote URL via `sanitize_collection_name`.
- `MODEL_DIMENSIONS` dict is duplicated in both `indexer/main.py` and `search-mcp/server.py` — keep them in sync.

### Go Multi-Module Setup

Three Go modules: `api-server/`, `go-services/`, `gen/go/`, linked by a `go.work` workspace at the root. Both `api-server` and `go-services` import `gen/go` via a `replace` directive. The `crypto/` and `provider/` packages are duplicated between `api-server` and `go-services` — keep them in sync.

`gen/go/` is gitignored — run `make proto` to generate it before building.

### Embedding

OpenAI-compatible models (`text-embedding-3-small` / `text-embedding-3-large`) called via OpenRouter (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`).
