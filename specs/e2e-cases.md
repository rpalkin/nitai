# E2E Test Cases

All planned end-to-end test cases for ai-reviewer. Cases 1–13 were designed by the planner based on codebase analysis. Cases A–O were identified by a product review of user-facing scenarios.

Tests marked `[SKIP]` cover features not yet implemented and are included as executable specs — the test code exists with `t.Skip(...)` and should pass once the feature is built.

---

## Cases 1–13 (Planner)

### Test 1 — Full pipeline via TriggerReview ✅ green
**Purpose:** Verify the complete happy path triggered via the admin API.

**Pre-conditions:**
- Full stack running (postgres, restate, api-server, worker, reviewer)
- Mock GitLab server running, configured to return:
  - `GET /api/v4/projects` → project list with one repo
  - `GET /api/v4/projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid` → MR details (not draft, not merged)
  - `GET /api/v4/projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid/changes` → small diff
  - `GET /api/v4/projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid/versions` → version list
  - `POST /api/v4/projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid/notes` → 200 OK (records call)
  - `POST /api/v4/projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid/discussions` → 200 OK (records call)
- Mock LLM server running, returning a valid `ReviewResponse` via tool calling format

**Steps:**
1. `ProviderService/CreateProvider` — register mock GitLab URL + token
2. `RepoService/ListRepos` — list repos for the provider
3. `RepoService/EnableReview` — enable review on the repo
4. `ReviewService/TriggerReview` — trigger review for MR IID=1
5. Poll `ReviewService/GetReviewRun` every 2s (timeout: 60s mock / 300s live) until status ≠ pending/running

**Assertions:**
- `GetReviewRun` returns status = COMPLETED
- `review_comments` table has ≥ 1 row with the expected `body` content
- Mock GitLab received exactly 1 POST to `/notes` (summary)
- Mock GitLab received ≥ 1 POST to `/discussions` (inline comments)
- Inline comment position: `new_path` matches expected file, `new_line` matches expected line

**Not asserted in live mode:** exact comment body (LLM output is non-deterministic)

**Flakiness mitigations:** Restate debounce not an issue for TriggerReview (force=true). Polling timeout is generous.

---

### Test 2 — Full pipeline via Webhook ✅ green
**Purpose:** Verify the complete happy path triggered by a simulated GitLab webhook.

**Pre-conditions:** Same as Test 1 (provider registered, repo review enabled, mocks configured).

**Webhook payload:**
```json
{
  "object_kind": "merge_request",
  "project": { "id": 1 },
  "object_attributes": {
    "iid": 1,
    "action": "open",
    "draft": false,
    "work_in_progress": false,
    "state": "opened"
  }
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Register provider + enable review (same as Test 1 steps 1–3)
2. `POST /webhooks/{provider_id}` with `X-Gitlab-Token` header and payload above
3. Query DB directly to find the created `review_runs` row (webhook doesn't return run ID)
4. Poll `GetReviewRun` until terminal status

**Assertions:** Same as Test 1 plus:
- Webhook returns HTTP 200
- `review_runs` row created in DB with `mr_iid=1`, `repo_id` matching the enabled repo

**Not asserted:** order of comment posting

---

### Test 3 — Invalid webhook secret → 401 🔴 red
**Purpose:** Verify webhook authentication rejects bad secrets.

**Steps:**
1. Register provider + enable review
2. `POST /webhooks/{provider_id}` with wrong/missing `X-Gitlab-Token`

**Assertions:**
- HTTP response is 401
- No `review_runs` row created in DB
- Mock LLM received 0 calls

---

### Test 4 — Unknown repo in webhook → no run created 🔴 red
**Purpose:** Verify webhook for an unregistered repo is accepted but produces no review.

**Steps:**
1. Register provider (no repos enabled)
2. `POST /webhooks/{provider_id}` with valid token but `project.id` not in DB

**Assertions:**
- HTTP 200 (webhook accepted)
- No `review_runs` row created
- Mock LLM received 0 calls

---

### Test 5 — Draft MR → run created with draft status, no LLM call 🔴 red
**Purpose:** Verify draft MRs are acknowledged but not reviewed.

**Webhook payload:** `"draft": true, "work_in_progress": true`

**Steps:**
1. Register provider + enable review
2. Send webhook with draft MR

**Assertions:**
- HTTP 200
- `review_runs` row created with `status = 'draft'` (checked via direct DB query)
- Mock LLM received 0 calls

2. Send webhook with `draft: true` → run created, no LLM call (as Test 5)
3. Send second webhook with `changes.draft.previous: true, changes.draft.current: false`
4. Poll `GetReviewRun` for the second run until COMPLETED

**Assertions:**
- Two `review_runs` rows: first with status=draft, second with status=completed
- Comments posted on second run
- Mock LLM called exactly once (for the second run only)

---

### Test 7 — Review disabled repo → no run created 🔴 red
**Purpose:** Verify webhooks for repos with review disabled produce no run.

**Steps:**
1. Register provider + enable review + disable review on the repo
2. Send valid non-draft webhook

**Assertions:**
- HTTP 200
- No new `review_runs` row created
- Mock LLM received 0 calls

---

### Test 8 — Large diff short-circuit ✅ green
**Purpose:** Verify diffs >5000 lines skip LLM and post a canned message.

**Pre-conditions:** Mock GitLab returns a dynamically generated 5001-line diff (built in test setup via `strings.Builder`).

**Steps:**
1. Register provider + enable review
2. `TriggerReview` for the large-diff MR
3. Poll until COMPLETED

**Assertions:**
- Status = COMPLETED
- Mock LLM received 0 calls
- Mock GitLab received 1 POST to `/notes` with body containing "too large" or equivalent canned message

---

### Test 9 — Duplicate diff dedup 🔴 red
**Purpose:** Verify the same diff hash sent twice produces only one review.

**Note:** This test is slow — Restate debounce timer (3 min) may apply on second invocation.

**Steps:**
1. Register provider + enable review
2. Send webhook → first review runs to COMPLETED
3. Send identical webhook (same MR, same diff hash) immediately
4. Wait for debounce + any second invocation to settle

**Assertions:**
- Only 1 `review_runs` row with status=completed for this MR
- Mock LLM called exactly once total

**Steps:**
1. Register provider + enable review
2. `ProviderService/DeleteProvider`
3. Send webhook for a repo under the deleted provider

**Assertions:**
- Provider row marked as deleted in DB
- Associated repo rows marked as deleted/disabled
- Webhook returns 200 but no new `review_runs` row created

---

### Test 11 — LLM terminal error → review FAILED 🔴 red
**Purpose:** Verify LLM HTTP 400 errors result in a failed review run, not a hang.

**Pre-conditions:** Mock LLM configured to return HTTP 400 for any request matching this test's diff content.

**Steps:**
1. Register provider + enable review
2. `TriggerReview`
3. Poll until terminal status

**Assertions:**
- `review_runs` status = FAILED
- Error message recorded in DB
- Mock GitLab received 0 POSTs to `/notes` or `/discussions`

---

### Test 12 — GitLab 404 for MR → review FAILED 🔴 red
**Purpose:** Verify GitLab returning 404 on MR fetch results in a failed review.

**Pre-conditions:** Mock GitLab configured to return 404 for `GET /merge_requests/:iid`.

**Steps:**
1. Register provider + enable review
2. `TriggerReview`
3. Poll until terminal status

**Assertions:**
- `review_runs` status = FAILED
- Error recorded in DB
- Mock LLM received 0 calls

---

### Test 13 — Semantic search: wrong function call detected [SKIP] ⚠️ spec
**Purpose:** Verify the reviewer finds a function definition via semantic search when it's not in the diff, and posts a comment about the argument mismatch.

**Status:** `t.Skip("semantic search not yet integrated into reviewer pipeline")` — this test is the executable spec for the feature.

**Pre-conditions:**
- Test repo at `e2e/testdata/semantic-repo/` indexed into Qdrant before the test runs
- `semantic-repo/pkg/mathutil/mathutil.go` contains:
  ```go
  func Foo(x int, y int) string { return fmt.Sprintf("%d+%d", x, y) }
  ```
- Diff (`e2e/testdata/semantic_diff.patch`) modifies `cmd/main.go` to call `mathutil.Foo(x)` — only 1 arg, missing second
- Diff does NOT include `mathutil.go`
- Mock LLM configured to return an inline comment on `cmd/main.go:10` with body: `"mathutil.Foo requires 2 arguments (x int, y int) but is called with only 1"`

**Key assertion (unique to this test):** The request sent to the LLM must contain the `Foo` definition in its context — proving the reviewer fetched it from Qdrant, not from the diff.

**Steps:**
1. Index semantic-repo into Qdrant
2. Register provider + enable review
3. `TriggerReview` with the semantic diff MR
4. Poll until COMPLETED

**Assertions:**
- Status = COMPLETED
- Inline comment on `cmd/main.go:10` with body matching "mathutil.Foo requires 2 arguments"
- LLM request payload contains the `Foo` function definition (from Qdrant context)
